# This workflow will upload a Python Package using Twine when a release is created
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python#publishing-to-package-registries

# It will also use PyInstaller to create a Windows executable and upload it to the GitHub release
